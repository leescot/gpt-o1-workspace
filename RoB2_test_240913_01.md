# Part A - Allocation Bias

## Question 1.1: Was the allocation sequence random?

**Answer: Y (Yes)**

**Reasoning:**

The study states: *"The random allocation of the patients into the melatonin or placebo group was conducted using the random number method by the responsible clinician."*

This indicates that a random component was used in the sequence generation, specifically the random number method, which aligns with acceptable randomization techniques.

---

## Question 1.2: Was the allocation sequence concealed until participants were enrolled and assigned to interventions?

**Answer: Y (Yes)**

**Reasoning:**

The study mentions: *"Randomized allocation was concealed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The allocation group was not revealed until an investigator provided the data of a fully eligible patient, which guaranteed the concealment of the randomization sequence."*

This description fits the criteria for proper allocation concealment using envelopes that are opaque, sequentially numbered, and sealed, ensuring that the allocation sequence was concealed until assignment.

---

## Question 1.3: Did baseline differences between intervention groups suggest a problem with the randomization process?

**Answer: N (No)**

**Reasoning:**

In Table 1, the baseline characteristics between the melatonin and placebo groups are compared. Most p-values are greater than 0.05, indicating no significant differences between groups. Although N2% had a p-value of 0.011 and PSQI-Component 3 had a p-value of 0.048, these are isolated instances:

- *"There were no significant differences in baseline demographic and sleep data between the two treatment groups (Table 1)."*

A small number of statistically significant differences at the 0.05 threshold are acceptable and likely due to chance when multiple comparisons are made.

| **Reason**           | The allocation sequence was randomly generated using the random number method, and allocation was concealed using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, with any observed differences likely due to chance and not indicative of a problem with the randomization process.                                                                                                                                       |

# Part B - Performance Bias (ITT Analysis Type)

## Question 2.1: Were participants aware of their assigned intervention during the trial?

**Answer: N (No)**

**Reasoning:**

The study specifies: *"The patients and investigators that assessing outcomes were blind to the random allocation of the treatment group (double-blind). Blinding was kept by using placebo with identical appearance, smell and taste of the melatonin tablet."*

Participants were blinded to their assigned interventions, fulfilling the criteria for a 'No' answer.

---

## Question 2.2: Were carers and people delivering the interventions aware of participants' assigned intervention?

**Answer: N (No)**

**Reasoning:**

As noted, the study was double-blind: *"The patients and investigators that assessing outcomes were blind to the random allocation of the treatment group (double-blind)."*

This implies that carers and personnel delivering the interventions were also blinded, meeting the criteria for a 'No' answer.

---

Since both 2.1 and 2.2 are 'No', we proceed to Question 2.6.

---

## Question 2.6: Was an appropriate analysis used to estimate the effect of assignment to intervention?

**Answer: N (No)**

**Reasoning:**

The study reports: *"By excluding patients that showed moderate-severe OSA or relevant periodic leg movements on polysomnographic results, 61 patients (29 with melatonin and 32 with placebo) were finally included for statistical analyses (Fig. 1)."*

Participants were excluded after randomization based on post-randomization assessments, indicating a per-protocol analysis rather than an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. This exclusion of eligible participants post-randomization is inappropriate.

---

## Question 2.7: Was there potential for a substantial impact (on the result) of the failure to analyze participants in the group to which they were randomized?

**Answer: Y (Yes)**

**Reasoning:**

A significant number of participants were excluded after randomizationâ€”36 out of 97 participants (approximately 37%). Such a substantial exclusion could bias the results, especially if the excluded participants differed systematically from those included. The potential impact on the study's findings is likely to be substantial.

# Part C - Missing Outcome Data

## Question 3.1: Were data for this outcome available for all, or nearly all, participants randomized?

**Answer: N (No)**

**Reasoning:**

The study notes: *"Of the 111 randomized patients, 97 patients (51 with melatonin and 46 with placebo) completed the study and had valid measurements. By excluding patients that showed moderate-severe OSA or relevant periodic leg movements on polysomnographic results, 61 patients (29 with melatonin and 32 with placebo) were finally included for statistical analyses."*

A significant portion of randomized participants (36 out of 97, approximately 37%) were excluded from the analysis, indicating that data for the primary outcome were not available for all or nearly all participants.

---

## Question 3.2: Is there evidence that the result was not biased by missing outcome data?

**Answer: N (No)**

**Reasoning:**

The study does not report any analysis methods to correct for potential bias due to missing data, such as appropriate statistical techniques or sensitivity analyses. There is no evidence provided to suggest that the missing outcome data did not bias the results.

---

## Question 3.3: Could missingness in the outcome depend on its true value?

**Answer: Y (Yes)**

**Reasoning:**

Participants were excluded based on the presence of moderate-severe OSA or periodic leg movements detected during polysomnography. These conditions could affect sleep onset latency, the primary outcome. Therefore, the missingness could depend on the true outcome value, as those with these conditions might have systematically different sleep onset latencies.

---

## Question 3.4: Is it likely that missingness in the outcome depended on its true value?

**Answer: Y (Yes)**

**Reasoning:**

Given that the excluded participants had conditions (moderate-severe OSA or periodic leg movements) that are known to influence sleep parameters, it is likely that missingness depended on the true value of the outcome. This selective exclusion could lead to biased estimates of the intervention effect.

| **Reason**           | A substantial proportion of participants were excluded after randomization due to conditions affecting sleep, without appropriate methods to address potential bias from missing data. Missingness is likely related to the true outcome value, as excluded participants may have different sleep onset latencies. This raises a high risk of bias due to missing outcome data impacting the study's conclusions. |

# Part D - Bias in Measurement of the Outcome

## Question 4.1: Was the method of measuring the outcome inappropriate?

**Answer: N (No)**

**Reasoning:**

The study utilized polysomnography (PSG) to measure sleep onset latency: *"The PSG (Alice 5; Respironics, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was performed in all the included patients... Scoring was performed automatically using computer software and were subsequently checked manually by a skilled technician."*

PSG is the gold standard for objective sleep measurement, and the method is appropriate for assessing sleep onset latency.

---

## Question 4.2: Could measurement or ascertainment of the outcome have differed between intervention groups?

**Answer: N (No)**

**Reasoning:**

All participants underwent PSG under the same conditions: *"The PSG was performed in all the included patients on the first and last night of treatment period... The light-off and beginning of PSG recordings were set at 22:30; the light-on and termination of PSG recordings were set at 6:30."*

Measurement methods and timing were consistent across both groups, indicating no differences in outcome measurement between intervention groups.

---

## Question 4.3: Were outcome assessors aware of the intervention received by study participants?

**Answer: N (No)**

**Reasoning:**

The study was double-blind: *"The patients and investigators that assessing outcomes were blind to the random allocation of the treatment group (double-blind)."*

Outcome assessors were blinded to the participants' group assignments, ensuring that assessment was not influenced by knowledge of the intervention.

| **Reason**           | The outcome was measured appropriately using polysomnography, a standardized and validated method. Measurement procedures were identical across intervention groups, and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments. There is a low risk of bias in the measurement of the outcome due to these rigorous and consistent methodologies.                                                                            |

# Part E - Bias in Selection of the Reported Result

## Question 5.2: Is the numerical result being assessed likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from multiple eligible outcome measurements within the outcome domain?

**Answer: NI (No Information)**

**Reasoning:**

There is insufficient information to determine if sleep onset latency was measured in multiple ways or if multiple scales or definitions were used within the outcome domain. The study does not provide details about other potential outcome measurements that were collected but not reported.

---

## Question 5.3: Is the numerical result being assessed likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from multiple eligible analyses of the data?

**Answer: NI (No Information)**

**Reasoning:**

The study does not specify whether multiple analyses were conducted for the primary outcome. There is no information about alternative statistical models or adjustments that might have been considered. Without access to the trial protocol or statistical analysis plan, it is unclear if selective reporting occurred based on the results.

---

## Question 5.1: Were the data that produced this result analyzed in accordance with a pre-specified analysis plan that was finalized before unblinded outcome data were available for analysis?

**Answer: NI (No Information)**

**Reasoning:**

While the study mentions that it was prospectively registered (*"Trial registration: Identifier: ChiCTR-TRC-13003997; Prospectively registered on 2 December 2013."*), it does not provide details about a pre-specified analysis plan or whether it was finalized before unblinded data were available. The timing and content of the analysis plan relative to data collection are not described.
